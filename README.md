## Business Request
DELIVR, a food delivery startup, wants to determine its profitability over the past few months. The Data Analytics Manager has requested a report showing the company's performance metrics to be presented to the stakeholders and potential investors. 

The major task of this project is to prepare an SQL report showing calculations of the business' performance (with the documented queries).

## Database Structure
The database contained data stored in three related tables;
* Meals: This contains information about the available meals, what each meal costs as well as the retail price.
* Orders: stores the date the order was placed, the quantity, and the id of the customer who placed the order.
* Stock: contains information about the date each meal was restocked and the quantity purchased.

## SQL Report
The report was created using Azure Data Studio to show the results of the analysis as well as document the queries used in generating the results. The report was saved as a Jupyter notebook **delivrnotebook.jpnb**
